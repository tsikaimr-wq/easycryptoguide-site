                <p><strong>October 21, 2025</strong></p>
                <p>Self-custody remains one of the most discussed topics in crypto. As more users move from passive holding to active portfolio management, expectations around wallet security and access control continue to rise.</p>
                <p>This article focuses on the practical question: when should a user keep assets on-platform for speed, and when should they move long-term holdings into their own storage workflow?</p>
                <p>The short answer is that convenience and control solve different problems. A strong exchange experience helps users trade and settle quickly, while self-custody becomes more important once operational discipline is in place.</p>
